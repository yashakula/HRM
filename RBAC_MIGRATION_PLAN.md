# RBAC Migration Plan for HRM System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the migration plan to transform the current role-based authentication system into a true Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) compliant system. The current implementation uses direct role checks and ownership validation, which limits scalability and flexibility. True RBAC will enable fine-grained permissions, multi-role support, and better security governance.

**Note**: Since this system is in development phase without production users or critical data, this migration can be executed as a direct refactoring without complex data migration procedures or rollback mechanisms.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Architecture
- **Single Role Per User**: Each user has exactly one role (HR_ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, EMPLOYEE)
- **Direct Role Checks**: API endpoints check user.role directly against enum values
- **Ownership-Based Access**: Additional checks for resource ownership scattered throughout codebase
- **Hardcoded Permissions**: Role capabilities are embedded in individual endpoint handlers

### Limitations
1. **No Multi-Role Support**: Users cannot have multiple roles simultaneously
2. **No Permission Granularity**: Cannot grant specific permissions without full role privileges
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Permission logic scattered across multiple files and duplicated
4. **Poor Auditability**: Difficult to track what permissions each role has system-wide
5. **Limited Scalability**: Adding new roles requires code changes throughout the system

## RBAC Compliance Goals

### Core RBAC Principles
1. **Users** are assigned to **Roles**
2. **Roles** are granted **Permissions**
3. **Permissions** control access to **Resources**
4. Users inherit permissions through their roles
5. Support for multiple roles per user

### Target Architecture
Users ←→ UserRoles ←→ Roles ←→ RolePermissions ←→ Permissions

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **System Complexity**: Increased complexity may introduce bugs and maintenance overhead
2. **Performance Impact**: Additional database queries for permission checks may impact performance
3. **Integration Issues**: New permission system may not integrate smoothly with existing features

### Development Risks
1. **Timeline Delays**: Complex refactoring may take longer than estimated
2. **Feature Regression**: Existing functionality may break during migration
3. **Testing Overhead**: Comprehensive testing of all permission combinations may be time-consuming

### Mitigation Strategies

## Conclusion

This RBAC migration represents a significant architectural improvement that will enhance the system's security, maintainability, and scalability. Since the system is still in development without production users, this migration can be executed as a direct refactoring without the complexity of data migration procedures or rollback mechanisms.

The streamlined approach focuses on clean implementation of RBAC principles while maintaining all existing functionality. The detailed task breakdown and timeline provide a clear roadmap for implementation, with appropriate risk mitigation strategies and success metrics to ensure project success.

The migration will establish a solid foundation for future growth, easier role management, and better security governance as the system moves toward production deployment.
