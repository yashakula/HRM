## User Story Implementation Status

### ✅ US-01: Create Employee Profile (COMPLETED)

**Original Requirements:**
- Form captures name, ID, department, and role
- Success confirmation is displayed

**Actual Implementation:**
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/employees/`
- **Data Captured**: 
  - Person: full_name, date_of_birth
  - Personal Information: personal_email, ssn, bank_account 
  - Employee: work_email, effective_start_date, effective_end_date, status
- **Success Response**: Full employee object with generated employee_id and timestamps

**Changes from Original Requirements:**
1. **Expanded Data Model**: Instead of basic "name, ID, department, role", we implemented a more comprehensive model:
   - Separated personal information (People table) from employee data
   - Added optional personal information (SSN, bank details, personal email)
   - Added effective date tracking for employment
   - Employee ID is auto-generated (not manually entered)

2. **Department & Role Handling**: 
   - **DEFERRED**: Department assignment will be handled via Assignment system (US-13/US-14)
   - This aligns with the ERD design where employees get departments through assignments

3. **Enhanced Features Added**:
   - Automatic status defaulting to "Active"
   - Comprehensive validation via Pydantic schemas
   - Full audit trail with created_at/updated_at timestamps

**API Response Example:**
```json
{
  "employee_id": 3,
  "people_id": 3,
  "status": "Active",
  "work_email": "test@company.com",
  "effective_start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "person": {
    "people_id": 3,
    "full_name": "Test Employee",
    "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
    "personal_information": {
      "personal_email": "test@example.com",
      "ssn": "123-45-6789",
      "bank_account": null
    }
  }
}
```
