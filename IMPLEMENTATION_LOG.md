# HRM Implementation Log

## User Story Implementation Status

### ✅ US-01: Create Employee Profile (COMPLETED)

**Original Requirements:**
- Form captures name, ID, department, and role
- Success confirmation is displayed

**Actual Implementation:**
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/employees/`
- **Data Captured**: 
  - Person: full_name, date_of_birth
  - Personal Information: personal_email, ssn, bank_account 
  - Employee: work_email, effective_start_date, effective_end_date, status
- **Success Response**: Full employee object with generated employee_id and timestamps

**Changes from Original Requirements:**
1. **Expanded Data Model**: Instead of basic "name, ID, department, role", we implemented a more comprehensive model:
   - Separated personal information (People table) from employee data
   - Added optional personal information (SSN, bank details, personal email)
   - Added effective date tracking for employment
   - Employee ID is auto-generated (not manually entered)

2. **Department & Role Handling**: 
   - **DEFERRED**: Department assignment will be handled via Assignment system (US-13/US-14)
   - This aligns with the ERD design where employees get departments through assignments

3. **Enhanced Features Added**:
   - Automatic status defaulting to "Active"
   - Comprehensive validation via Pydantic schemas
   - Full audit trail with created_at/updated_at timestamps

**API Response Example:**
```json
{
  "employee_id": 3,
  "people_id": 3,
  "status": "Active",
  "work_email": "test@company.com",
  "effective_start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "person": {
    "people_id": 3,
    "full_name": "Test Employee",
    "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
    "personal_information": {
      "personal_email": "test@example.com",
      "ssn": "123-45-6789",
      "bank_account": null
    }
  }
}
```

**Testing Coverage:**
- ✅ Minimal employee creation (name only)
- ✅ Full employee creation with all fields
- ✅ Validation error handling
- ✅ Employee retrieval by ID
- ✅ Employee listing
- ✅ Error cases (missing data, invalid formats)

**Technical Implementation:**
- FastAPI with Pydantic schemas for validation
- SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships
- pytest test suite with SQLite test database
- Docker containerization with PostgreSQL

1. **User Authentication**
   - Session-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies (secure)
   - Secure password hashing using bcrypt
   - User registration, login, and logout endpoints
   - Session token validation with itsdangerous

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Three user roles: `HR_ADMIN`, `SUPERVISOR`, `EMPLOYEE`
   - Role-based decorators: `@require_hr_admin()`, `@require_supervisor_or_admin()`, etc.
   - Access control enforcement on all endpoints

3. **Database Schema Updates**
   - `User` table with authentication data
   - `UserRole` enum (HR_ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, EMPLOYEE)
   - `Employee.user_id` foreign key linking employees to system users

**API Endpoints Added**:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login (sets HTTP-only session cookie)
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Get current user information
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Logout endpoint (clears session cookie)

**Security Implementation**:
- Employee creation restricted to HR_ADMIN role only
- Employee viewing requires authentication (any role)
- Proper HTTP status codes (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden)
- Password data excluded from API responses
- Session token expiration (24 hours default)
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks

**Updated Employee Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/employees/` - Now requires HR_ADMIN role
- `GET /api/v1/employees/` - Now requires authentication (any role)
- `GET /api/v1/employees/{id}` - Now requires authentication (any role)

**Live Testing Results**:
- ✅ HR Admin can create employees
- ✅ Supervisor cannot create employees (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Employee cannot create employees (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Unauthenticated requests blocked (401 Unauthorized)
- ✅ All roles can view employees when authenticated

**Technical Details**:

## ✅ UI/UX CONTRAST IMPROVEMENTS (COMPLETED)

**Implementation Date**: 2025-06-25

**Problem Identified**: Multiple components across the frontend had poor text contrast with light grey text (#9ca3af, #6b7280) on white backgrounds, making content difficult to read and failing accessibility standards.

**Affected Components:**
- Department page main heading and content
- Employee form fields and labels
- Assignment page headers and table content
- Button text and form placeholders
- General body text and navigation elements

**Solution Implemented**: Global CSS override approach for scalable contrast improvements

### Technical Implementation:

#### 1. Tailwind CSS Theme Updates (`tailwind.config.js`)
```javascript
colors: {
  gray: {
    400: '#6b7280', // Originally #9ca3af - now darker
    500: '#374151', // Originally #6b7280 - now darker  
    600: '#1f2937', // Originally #4b5563 - now darker
    700: '#111827', // Originally #374151 - now darker
    800: '#111827', // Originally #1f2937 - keeping dark
    900: '#111827', // Originally #111827 - keeping darkest
  }
}
```

#### 2. Global CSS Overrides (`globals.css`)
```css
/* Override default text colors for better contrast */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  color: #111827 !important; /* text-gray-900 equivalent */
}

/* Input fields and form elements */
input, textarea, select {
  color: #111827 !important;
}

/* Override light gray text classes with darker alternatives */
.text-gray-400 {
  color: #6b7280 !important; /* text-gray-500 equivalent */
}

.text-gray-500 {
  color: #374151 !important; /* text-gray-700 equivalent */
}

/* Placeholder text improvements */
::placeholder {
  color: #6b7280 !important;
}

/* Default text color for better contrast */
body, p, div, span {
  color: #111827;
}
```

#### 3. Benefits of Global Approach
- **Scalable**: Affects all components automatically without individual edits
- **Consistent**: Ensures uniform contrast improvements across the application
- **Maintainable**: Single point of control for text contrast standards
- **Future-Proof**: New components automatically inherit improved contrast
- **Accessibility**: Meets WCAG contrast ratio requirements

#### 4. Alternative Solutions Considered
- **Option 1**: Global CSS overrides (implemented)
- **Option 2**: Component-by-component CSS class updates
- **Option 3**: Custom Tailwind CSS theme with darker defaults

**Impact:**
- ✅ Improved readability across all pages and components
- ✅ Better accessibility compliance (WCAG contrast ratios)
- ✅ Enhanced user experience for all user roles
- ✅ Reduced eye strain for extended use
- ✅ Professional appearance with proper contrast hierarchy

**Deployment:**
- Changes applied via Docker container rebuild: `docker-compose build frontend`
- Successfully deployed and tested across multiple browser environments
- Verified compatibility with existing design system and component library

GET /api/v1/employees/search?name=John

# Search by employee ID
GET /api/v1/employees/search?employee_id=123

# Filter by status
GET /api/v1/employees/search?status=Active

# Combined search with pagination
GET /api/v1/employees/search?name=Smith&status=Active&limit=10&skip=0
```

**Response Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "employee_id": 1,
    "people_id": 1,
    "status": "Active",
    "work_email": "john.smith@company.com",
    "effective_start_date": "2024-01-01",

#### Backend Authentication Updates
```python
# Enhanced UserResponse schema to include employee association
class UserResponse(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    username: str
    email: str
    role: UserRole
    is_active: bool
    created_at: datetime
    employee: Optional["EmployeeResponse"] = None  # Associated employee if exists

# Updated /me endpoint to fetch associated employee
@router.get("/me", response_model=schemas.UserResponse)
def read_current_user(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user), db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    employee = db.query(models.Employee).filter(models.Employee.user_id == current_user.user_id).first()
    return {..., "employee": employee}
```

#### Frontend Access Control Logic
```typescript
// Determine access permissions
const isOwnRecord = user?.employee?.employee_id === employeeId;
const canEdit = isHRAdmin && isEditMode;
const canViewSensitiveInfo = isOwnRecord;
const canEditSensitiveInfo = isOwnRecord && isEditMode;

// Conditional rendering for sensitive information
{canViewSensitiveInfo && (
  <div>
    <h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
    {canEditSensitiveInfo ? (
      <input {...register('ssn')} />

  onSuccess: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['employeeAssignments', employee.employee_id] });
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['assignments'] });
    setDeleteError(null);
  },
  onError: (error: unknown) => {
    const httpError = error as { response?: { status?: number } };
    if (httpError?.response?.status === 403) {
      setDeleteError('Permission denied: Only HR Administrators can delete assignments');
    } else if (httpError?.response?.status === 404) {
      setDeleteError('Assignment not found');

## ✅ ASSIGNMENT FUNCTIONALITY INTEGRATION & BUG FIXES (COMPLETED)

**Implementation Date**: 2025-06-26

**Problem**: Assignment functionality was separated on a standalone page, but user requirements called for integrating assignment management into the employee page. Additionally, assignment/department filtering was not working due to several technical issues.

### Phase 1: Assignment Integration into Employee Page

**Changes Made:**
1. **Enhanced Employee Page** (`/employees/page.tsx`):
   - Added assignment filtering capabilities (department, assignment type)
   - Integrated assignment creation dialog for HR Admins
   - Added assignment summary display within employee table
   - Implemented "Show Assignment Details" toggle for clean UI
   - Added assignment status badges (Active/Ended/Future)

2. **Navigation Updates**:
   - Updated navbar from "Assignments" to "Employees & Assignments"
   - Created redirect from `/assignments` to `/employees` page
   - Removed standalone assignments page functionality

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Assignment filtering appears only when "Show Assignment Details" is checked
   - Assignment creation button available for HR Admins only
   - Assignment summary shows up to 3 assignments per employee
   - Role-based permissions maintained throughout

### Phase 2: Critical Bug Fixes

**Issue 1: Assignment Query Dependency Problem**
- **Problem**: Assignments only loaded when "Show Assignment Details" was checked, but filtering depended on having assignment data
- **Fix**: Removed `enabled: showAssignments` constraint, making assignments always load for filtering
- **File**: `/frontend/src/app/employees/page.tsx:68`

**Issue 2: API URL Construction Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Frontend missing trailing slash (`/api/v1/assignments`) while backend expected (`/api/v1/assignments/`)
- **Fix**: Added trailing slash to getAll API call
- **File**: `/frontend/src/lib/api/assignments.ts:30`

**Issue 3: Employee Filtering Logic Error**
- **Problem**: Filter logic assumed assignments existed but could be undefined, causing incorrect filtering
- **Fix**: Improved filtering logic to handle undefined assignments data properly
- **File**: `/frontend/src/app/employees/page.tsx:437-456`

**Issue 4: Missing Error Handling**
- **Problem**: No error states for assignment loading failures
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `assignmentsError` and `assignmentsLoading` to query
  - Warning message for assignment loading failures
  - Loading states in assignment display cells

**Issue 5: Inefficient Query Performance**
- **Problem**: Assignment type queries running unnecessarily when no department selected
- **Fix**: Optimized queries to only run when needed
- **Implementation**:
  - Create form assignment types: only when dialog open + department selected
  - Filter assignment types: only when department selected for filtering

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Assignment Filtering Logic
```typescript
// Enhanced filtering that handles undefined assignments
.filter(employee => {
  if (!assignments) return true; // Loading state
  if (!filterDepartmentId && !filterAssignmentTypeId) return true; // No filters
  
  const employeeAssignments = assignments.filter(a => a.employee_id === employee.employee_id);
  if (employeeAssignments.length === 0) return false; // No assignments when filters active
  
  return employeeAssignments.some(assignment => {
    const deptMatch = !filterDepartmentId || assignment.assignment_type.department.department_id.toString() === filterDepartmentId;
    const typeMatch = !filterAssignmentTypeId || assignment.assignment_type_id.toString() === filterAssignmentTypeId;
    return deptMatch && typeMatch;
  });
})
```

#### Error Handling Implementation
```typescript
const { data: assignments, isLoading: assignmentsLoading, error: assignmentsError } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['assignments', filterDepartmentId, filterAssignmentTypeId],
  queryFn: () => assignmentApi.getAll({...}),
  enabled: true, // Always enabled for filtering
});

// UI Error Display
{assignmentsError && (
  <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-md p-4">
    <p className="text-yellow-600">
      Warning: Assignment data could not be loaded. Assignment filtering may not work properly.
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Query Optimization
```typescript
// Before: Always enabled
enabled: true

// After: Conditionally enabled
enabled: isCreateDialogOpen && !!selectedDepartment // Create form
enabled: !!filterDepartmentId // Filtering
```

### Testing & Validation

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Docker containers rebuild and deploy without issues
- ✅ Backend API endpoints respond correctly (trailing slash fix verified)

- **Results Table**: Comprehensive assignment details including:
  - Employee information and ID
  - Role/assignment type with description
  - Department information
  - Supervisor assignments with badges
  - Effective dates (start/end)
  - Status badges (Active/Ended/Future)
- **Assignment Creation**: HR Admin button for creating new assignments (moved from header to tab)

#### 5. Technical Implementation

**Query Optimization**:
```typescript
// Tab-based query enablement for performance
enabled: activeTab === 'employees'  // Employee queries
enabled: activeTab === 'assignments'  // Assignment queries
```

**State Management**:
```typescript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'employees' | 'assignments'>('employees');
// Separate state management for each tab's filters
const [employeeSearchParams, setEmployeeSearchParams] = useState<EmployeeSearchParams>({...});
const [assignmentFilterDepartmentId, setAssignmentFilterDepartmentId] = useState<string>('');
```

**Assignment Creation Integration**:
- Contextual placement within Assignment Search tab
- Maintained all existing functionality from previous implementation
- HR Admin role-based access control preserved

#### 6. User Experience Improvements

**Clean Navigation**:
- Tab switching preserves individual tab state
- Visual indicators for active tab
- Hover effects for better interactivity

**Optimized Performance**:
- Data only loads for active tab
- Conditional query enablement reduces unnecessary API calls
- Efficient state management prevents cross-tab interference

**Contextual Actions**:
- Assignment creation button moved to Assignment Search tab
- Clear separation of functionality between employee and assignment management
- Preserved all existing search and filtering capabilities

## Database Schema Alignment

The implementation successfully aligns with the ERD design:
- ✅ People table (core person data)
- ✅ PersonalInformation table (sensitive personal data) 
- ✅ Employee table (employment-specific data)
- ✅ Assignment system (fully implemented with management interface)
- ✅ Department linkage (complete with assignment types and filtering)
- ✅ User-Employee relationship (enables sensitive data access control)
