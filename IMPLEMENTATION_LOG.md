### ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel Deployment with Authentication Fix (December 27, 2025)

**Complete Production Tunnel Implementation:**
- **Cloudflare Tunnel Integration**: Full Docker-based tunnel deployment with authentication
- **Cookie Authentication Fix**: Resolved cross-origin cookie issues for tunnel domains
- **Multi-Environment Framework**: Extended dev/prod architecture with tunnel support
- **Production-Ready Security**: Secure cookie handling across tunnel domains

**Authentication System Enhancements:**
- **Environment-Aware Cookies**: Dynamic cookie configuration based on deployment mode
- **Tunnel Compatibility**: Proper `secure=true`, `samesite=none`, `domain=.yashakula.com` settings
- **CORS Resolution**: Backend configured to accept requests from tunnel domains
- **Frontend Build Fix**: Next.js builds with correct tunnel API URLs (no more localhost references)

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Cookie Configuration**: Environment variables control cookie security settings
- **Frontend Dockerfile**: Build-time environment variable support for API URLs
- **Backend CORS**: Dynamic origin configuration from environment variables
- **Tunnel Service**: Cloudflare tunnel integrated into Docker Compose

**Files Added/Enhanced:**
- `deployment/.env.tunnel` - Tunnel-specific environment configuration
- `deployment/docker-compose.tunnel.yml` - Cloudflare tunnel service definition
- `deployment/TUNNEL_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive tunnel setup and troubleshooting guide
- `backend/src/hrm_backend/auth.py` - Environment-aware cookie configuration
- `backend/src/hrm_backend/main.py` - Dynamic CORS origins support
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Build-time environment variable support
- `deployment/run_containers.sh` - Tunnel environment support

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
./deployment/run_containers.sh start --env dev     # Development (localhost)
./deployment/run_containers.sh start --env prod    # Production (local testing)
./deployment/run_containers.sh start --env tunnel  # Cloudflare tunnel (production)
```

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Frontend calls `https://yashakula.com/api/v1/auth/login`
2. Cloudflare tunnel routes to internal backend
3. Backend sets secure cookies with tunnel-compatible attributes  
4. Browser stores cookies for tunnel domain
5. Session persists across all tunnel pages

**Current Status**: ✅ Authentication working perfectly through Cloudflare tunnel at https://yashakula.com

**Previous Infrastructure Enhancement:** Multi-Environment Docker Deployment Architecture
- **Consolidated Deployment Files**: Moved all Docker and environment configuration to `deployment/` folder
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Implemented separate development and production configurations
- **Enhanced Security**: Production mode restricts database/backend access to internal networking only
- **Environment Management**: Automatic environment file loading (`.env.development`/`.env.production`)
- **Enhanced Deployment Script**: Support for `--env dev/prod/tunnel` flags with comprehensive status reporting

## User Story Implementation Status

### ✅ US-01: Create Employee Profile (COMPLETED)

**Original Requirements:**
- Form captures name, ID, department, and role
- Success confirmation is displayed

**Actual Implementation:**
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/employees/`
- **Data Captured**: 
  - Person: full_name, date_of_birth
  - Personal Information: personal_email, ssn, bank_account 
  - Employee: work_email, effective_start_date, effective_end_date, status
- **Success Response**: Full employee object with generated employee_id and timestamps

**Changes from Original Requirements:**
1. **Expanded Data Model**: Instead of basic "name, ID, department, role", we implemented a more comprehensive model:
   - Separated personal information (People table) from employee data
   - Added optional personal information (SSN, bank details, personal email)
   - Added effective date tracking for employment
   - Employee ID is auto-generated (not manually entered)

2. **Department & Role Handling**: 
   - **DEFERRED**: Department assignment will be handled via Assignment system (US-13/US-14)
   - This aligns with the ERD design where employees get departments through assignments

3. **Enhanced Features Added**:
   - Automatic status defaulting to "Active"
   - Comprehensive validation via Pydantic schemas
   - Full audit trail with created_at/updated_at timestamps

**API Response Example:**
```json
{
  "employee_id": 3,
  "people_id": 3,
  "status": "Active",
  "work_email": "test@company.com",
  "effective_start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "person": {
    "people_id": 3,
    "full_name": "Test Employee",
    "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
    "personal_information": {
      "personal_email": "test@example.com",
      "ssn": "123-45-6789",
      "bank_account": null
    }
  }
}
```

**Testing Coverage:**
- ✅ Minimal employee creation (name only)
- ✅ Full employee creation with all fields
- ✅ Validation error handling
- ✅ Employee retrieval by ID
- ✅ Employee listing
- ✅ Error cases (missing data, invalid formats)

**Technical Implementation:**
