# HRM Implementation Log

## User Story Implementation Status

### ✅ US-01: Create Employee Profile (COMPLETED)

**Original Requirements:**
- Form captures name, ID, department, and role
- Success confirmation is displayed

**Actual Implementation:**
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/employees/`
- **Data Captured**: 
  - Person: full_name, date_of_birth
  - Personal Information: personal_email, ssn, bank_account 
  - Employee: work_email, effective_start_date, effective_end_date, status
- **Success Response**: Full employee object with generated employee_id and timestamps

**Changes from Original Requirements:**
1. **Expanded Data Model**: Instead of basic "name, ID, department, role", we implemented a more comprehensive model:
   - Separated personal information (People table) from employee data
   - Added optional personal information (SSN, bank details, personal email)
   - Added effective date tracking for employment
   - Employee ID is auto-generated (not manually entered)

2. **Department & Role Handling**: 
   - **DEFERRED**: Department assignment will be handled via Assignment system (US-13/US-14)
   - This aligns with the ERD design where employees get departments through assignments

3. **Enhanced Features Added**:
   - Automatic status defaulting to "Active"
   - Comprehensive validation via Pydantic schemas
   - Full audit trail with created_at/updated_at timestamps

**API Response Example:**
```json
{
  "employee_id": 3,
  "people_id": 3,
  "status": "Active",
  "work_email": "test@company.com",
  "effective_start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "person": {
    "people_id": 3,
    "full_name": "Test Employee",
    "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
    "personal_information": {
      "personal_email": "test@example.com",
      "ssn": "123-45-6789",
      "bank_account": null
    }
  }
}
```

**Testing Coverage:**
- ✅ Minimal employee creation (name only)
- ✅ Full employee creation with all fields
- ✅ Validation error handling
- ✅ Employee retrieval by ID
- ✅ Employee listing
- ✅ Error cases (missing data, invalid formats)

**Technical Implementation:**
- FastAPI with Pydantic schemas for validation
- SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships
- pytest test suite with SQLite test database
- Docker containerization with PostgreSQL

**Features Implemented**:
1. **User Authentication**
   - Session-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies (secure)
   - Secure password hashing using bcrypt
   - User registration, login, and logout endpoints
   - Session token validation with itsdangerous

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Three user roles: `HR_ADMIN`, `SUPERVISOR`, `EMPLOYEE`
   - Role-based decorators: `@require_hr_admin()`, `@require_supervisor_or_admin()`, etc.
   - Access control enforcement on all endpoints

3. **Database Schema Updates**
   - `User` table with authentication data
   - `UserRole` enum (HR_ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, EMPLOYEE)
   - `Employee.user_id` foreign key linking employees to system users

**API Endpoints Added**:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login (sets HTTP-only session cookie)
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Get current user information
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Logout endpoint (clears session cookie)

**Security Implementation**:
- Employee creation restricted to HR_ADMIN role only
- Employee viewing requires authentication (any role)
- Proper HTTP status codes (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden)
- Password data excluded from API responses
- Session token expiration (24 hours default)
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks

**Updated Employee Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/employees/` - Now requires HR_ADMIN role
- `GET /api/v1/employees/` - Now requires authentication (any role)
- `GET /api/v1/employees/{id}` - Now requires authentication (any role)

**Live Testing Results**:
- ✅ HR Admin can create employees
- ✅ Supervisor cannot create employees (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Employee cannot create employees (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Unauthenticated requests blocked (401 Unauthorized)
- ✅ All roles can view employees when authenticated

**Technical Details**:
- Session secret key configurable via environment variable (fallback: auto-generated)
- Session expiration: 24 hours (configurable)
- Password hashing: bcrypt with salt
- Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Session management: itsdangerous for secure token signing
- Cookie security: HTTP-only, SameSite=Lax protection

## ✅ UI/UX CONTRAST IMPROVEMENTS (COMPLETED)

**Implementation Date**: 2025-06-25

**Problem Identified**: Multiple components across the frontend had poor text contrast with light grey text (#9ca3af, #6b7280) on white backgrounds, making content difficult to read and failing accessibility standards.

**Affected Components:**
- Department page main heading and content
- Employee form fields and labels
- Assignment page headers and table content
- Button text and form placeholders
- General body text and navigation elements

**Solution Implemented**: Global CSS override approach for scalable contrast improvements

### Technical Implementation:

#### 1. Tailwind CSS Theme Updates (`tailwind.config.js`)
```javascript
colors: {
  gray: {
    400: '#6b7280', // Originally #9ca3af - now darker
    500: '#374151', // Originally #6b7280 - now darker  
    600: '#1f2937', // Originally #4b5563 - now darker
    700: '#111827', // Originally #374151 - now darker
    800: '#111827', // Originally #1f2937 - keeping dark
    900: '#111827', // Originally #111827 - keeping darkest
  }
}
```

#### 2. Global CSS Overrides (`globals.css`)
```css
/* Override default text colors for better contrast */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  color: #111827 !important; /* text-gray-900 equivalent */
}

/* Input fields and form elements */
input, textarea, select {
  color: #111827 !important;
}

/* Override light gray text classes with darker alternatives */
.text-gray-400 {
  color: #6b7280 !important; /* text-gray-500 equivalent */
}

.text-gray-500 {
  color: #374151 !important; /* text-gray-700 equivalent */
}

/* Placeholder text improvements */
::placeholder {
  color: #6b7280 !important;
}

/* Default text color for better contrast */
body, p, div, span {
  color: #111827;
}
```

#### 3. Benefits of Global Approach
- **Scalable**: Affects all components automatically without individual edits
- **Consistent**: Ensures uniform contrast improvements across the application
- **Maintainable**: Single point of control for text contrast standards
- **Future-Proof**: New components automatically inherit improved contrast
- **Accessibility**: Meets WCAG contrast ratio requirements

#### 4. Alternative Solutions Considered
- **Option 1**: Global CSS overrides (implemented)
- **Option 2**: Component-by-component CSS class updates
- **Option 3**: Custom Tailwind CSS theme with darker defaults

**Impact:**
- ✅ Improved readability across all pages and components
- ✅ Better accessibility compliance (WCAG contrast ratios)
- ✅ Enhanced user experience for all user roles
- ✅ Reduced eye strain for extended use
- ✅ Professional appearance with proper contrast hierarchy

**Deployment:**
- Changes applied via Docker container rebuild: `docker-compose build frontend`
- Successfully deployed and tested across multiple browser environments
- Verified compatibility with existing design system and component library

- Role-based views for HR Admin, Supervisors, and Employees

**Actual Implementation:**
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/employees/search`
- **Search Parameters**:
  - `name` (optional): Search by employee full name (case-insensitive partial match)
  - `employee_id` (optional): Search by specific employee ID
  - `status` (optional): Filter by employee status (Active/Inactive)
  - `skip` (optional): Pagination offset (default: 0)
  - `limit` (optional): Maximum results per page (default: 100, max: 1000)

**Search Features:**
1. **Flexible Search**: Supports partial name matching using ILIKE for case-insensitive searches
2. **Multiple Filters**: Can combine name, employee_id, and status filters
3. **Pagination**: Built-in pagination with skip/limit parameters
4. **Role-Based Access**: All authenticated users can search (HR_ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, EMPLOYEE)
5. **Rich Data Response**: Returns full employee details including personal information

**API Examples:**
```bash
# Search by name
GET /api/v1/employees/search?name=John

# Search by employee ID
GET /api/v1/employees/search?employee_id=123

# Filter by status
GET /api/v1/employees/search?status=Active

# Combined search with pagination
GET /api/v1/employees/search?name=Smith&status=Active&limit=10&skip=0
```

**Response Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "employee_id": 1,
    "people_id": 1,
    "status": "Active",
    "work_email": "john.smith@company.com",
    "effective_start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "person": {
      "people_id": 1,
      "full_name": "John Smith",
      "date_of_birth": "1990-05-15",
      "personal_information": {
