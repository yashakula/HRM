# HRM Security Improvements Tracking

## Strategic Decision: Hybrid API Approach

**Decision Date**: 2025-06-26  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - Hybrid REST + GraphQL Strategy**

### Implementation Strategy
- **Existingment Priority 1 security tasks immediately
- **New APIs**: Use GraphQL with field-level authorization for future de APIs**: Continue with current REST + FastAPI approach, implevelopment
- **Migration**: Evaluate existing endpoint migration on case-by-case basis based on maintenance burden and security complexity

### Rationale
This hybrid approach provides immediate security improvements while positioning for better long-term architecture:
- **Risk Management**: No breaking changes to existing functionality during transition
- **Incremental Learning**: Team gains GraphQL expertise on new features without pressure
- **Immediate Value**: Critical security vulnerabilities addressed using proven REST patterns
- **Future Flexibility**: GraphQL proves its value on new features before broader adoption

### Next Steps
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Implement Priority 1 security tasks using current REST approach
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Develop GraphQL proof-of-concept for new APIs with field-level authorization
3. **Phase 3 (Month 2)**: Evaluate success and plan selective migration of existing endpoints

## Overview
This document tracks security improvements needed for the HRM system's role-based access control implementation. While the system has a solid foundation with excellent backend API protection, several critical gaps need to be addressed before production deployment.

## Current Security Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- **Backend API Protection**: All endpoints properly protected with role-based decorators
- **Authentication System**: Session-based auth with HTTP-only cookies and bcrypt password hashing
- **Role Structure**: Well-defined three-tier role system (HR_ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, EMPLOYEE)
- **Frontend Navigation**: Basic role-based UI element visibility

### ‚ùå Critical Security Gaps
1. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: All authenticated users can see SSN and bank account data
2. **Missing Data Ownership Controls**: Employees can access other employees' data
3. **Frontend Route Protection**: Client-side role checks can be bypassed
4. **No Audit Logging**: No tracking of sensitive data access

  - [x] Update endpoint return type annotations to accept Union of all three schema types for proper OpenAPI documentation
  - [x] Modify the employee search endpoint to apply role-based filtering to each employee record in the results list
  - [x] Create helper function to determine which schema to use based on user role, employee ownership, and supervisor relationships
  - [x] Add logic to check if requesting user is the owner of the employee record being accessed
  - [x] Import all new response schema classes and Union type from typing module
  - [x] Ensure error handling remains consistent while adding new permission checks
- [x] **1.1.3** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Create response filtering utility functions in `src/hrm_backend/auth.py`
  - [x] Build central filtering function that takes employee data, current user, and ownership flag to return appropriately filtered response
  - [x] Implement logic that returns HR schema for HR_ADMIN users regardless of ownership
  - [x] Add logic that returns owner schema for employees accessing their own records
  - [x] Default to basic schema for all other cases including supervisors and employees viewing others
  - [x] Create employee ownership checking function that queries the user-employee relationship to determine if user owns the employee record
  - [x] Build supervisor relationship checking function that queries assignment and supervisor tables to determine supervisory relationships
  - [x] Add proper error handling for cases where relationships cannot be determined
  - [x] Import all necessary types and ensure function signatures match usage in endpoint files
- [x] **1.1.4** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Create comprehensive test suite for role-based response filtering in new `tests/test_employee_security.py` file
  - [x] Design test cases where HR_ADMIN users access any employee record and verify all sensitive fields are present in response JSON
  - [x] Create test scenarios where employees access their own records and confirm they receive complete data including sensitive information
  - [x] Build tests where employees attempt to access other employee records and verify sensitive fields are completely absent from response
  - [x] Design supervisor test cases where supervisors access supervisee records and confirm they receive basic information without sensitive data
  - [x] Create test fixtures that establish users with each role type and corresponding employee records

- SUPERVISOR and EMPLOYEE users do not see SSN or bank_account fields
- Employees can see their own complete data when accessing their own record

#### Task 1.2: Implement Data Ownership Controls
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Completed Time**: 3 hours  

**Subtasks:**
- [x] **1.2.1** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Add ownership validation middleware in `src/hrm_backend/auth.py`
  - [x] Create a decorator function called `validate_employee_access` that accepts a boolean parameter to control whether supervisor access is allowed. This decorator wraps FastAPI endpoint functions and performs ownership validation before allowing access to employee data. The decorator extracts the employee_id and current_user from function arguments and implements a hierarchical access control system where HR_ADMIN users can access any employee record, employees can access their own records, and supervisors can optionally access their supervisees' records if the allow_supervisor_access flag is True. When access is denied, the decorator raises an HTTP 403 exception with a descriptive error message.
  - [x] Implement helper functions including `get_employee_by_user_id` for querying employee records by user relationship, handling cases where users might not have associated employee records.
  - [x] Create standardized error response handling with detailed access denied messages including user role and required permissions.
  - [x] Add necessary imports for HTTPException from FastAPI, UserRole enum from models, and database session management utilities.
- [x] **1.2.2** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Update employee endpoints in `src/hrm_backend/routers/employees.py` with ownership checks
  - [x] Apply the ownership validation decorator to the individual employee GET endpoint, enabling supervisor access since supervisors should be able to view their supervisees' records.
  - [x] Apply the ownership validation decorator to the employee UPDATE endpoint, with supervisor access disabled since only HR_ADMIN and the employee themselves should be able to modify employee records.
  - [x] Update the imports section of the employees router file to include the new ownership validation decorator from the auth module.
  - [x] Verify that HR_ADMIN users can bypass all ownership restrictions through comprehensive testing.
  - [x] Convert endpoints to async functions to work with the ownership validation decorator.
- [x] **1.2.3** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Implement supervisor access controls in `src/hrm_backend/auth.py`
  - [x] Create `check_supervisor_relationship` function that determines whether a supervisor has authority over a specified employee by checking assignment-supervisor relationships.
  - [x] Implement database queries using SQLAlchemy to check assignment-supervisor relationships through Assignment and AssignmentSupervisor table joins.
  - [x] Add robust error handling for cases where supervisor or employee records don't exist or database queries fail.
  - [x] Import necessary database models including Assignment, Employee, and AssignmentSupervisor from the models module.
- [x] **1.2.4** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Add proper error responses and standardized exception handling
  - [x] Implement standardized error response function `create_access_denied_response` that creates HTTPException objects with consistent 403 status codes and detailed error information including error type, descriptive message, user role, and required permissions.
  - [x] Ensure users receive clear feedback about why access was denied and what permissions would be required for access.
  - [x] *(Note: Security audit logging components were removed per user request to skip audit log functionality)*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Employees can only access their own employee record
- Supervisors can access their supervisees' records
- HR_ADMIN can access any employee record
- Proper 403 errors returned for unauthorized access

#### Task 1.3: Secure Assignment Data Access
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Completed Time**: 2 hours  

**Subtasks:**
- [x] **1.3.1** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Add assignment ownership validation
  - [x] Implement ownership validation logic that determines whether a user can view specific assignment records by checking if they are the assigned employee, a supervisor of the assignment, or have HR_ADMIN privileges. This should work similarly to employee record access but focused on assignment-specific relationships.
  - [x] Configure employee access restrictions so that employees can only view assignments where they are the assigned employee, preventing them from seeing other employees' assignment details, schedules, or supervisory relationships.
  - [x] Implement supervisor access controls that allow supervisors to view assignments only for employees they supervise, using the assignment-supervisor relationship tables to determine which assignments they have authority to access.
- [x] **1.3.2** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Filter assignment search results by role
  - [x] Modify the assignment search endpoint to apply role-based filtering at the database query level, ensuring that the results returned are automatically limited based on the requesting user's role and relationships before any data is sent to the client.
  - [x] Implement employee-specific filtering for assignment search results that limits the query to only return assignments where the requesting employee is the assigned employee, using database joins and WHERE clauses to enforce this at the SQL level.
  - [x] Create supervisor-specific filtering logic that limits assignment search results to only assignments where the requesting supervisor has supervisory authority, using the assignment-supervisor relationship tables to determine accessible assignments.
- [x] **1.3.3** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Test assignment access controls
  - [x] Develop comprehensive unit tests for assignment access control logic that test each role type attempting to access various assignment scenarios, including edge cases like employees trying to access other employees' assignments and supervisors trying to access assignments outside their authority.
  - [x] Create integration tests that make actual HTTP requests to assignment endpoints with different user roles and verify that the proper assignment data is returned or that appropriate error responses are generated for unauthorized access attempts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Employees only see their own assignments
- Supervisors only see assignments they supervise
- HR_ADMIN sees all assignments

### üîí **PRIORITY 2: FRONTEND SECURITY ENHANCEMENT**

#### Task 2.1: Implement Server-Side Route Protection
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Completed Time**: 3 hours  

**Subtasks:**
- [x] **2.1.1** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Create role validation API endpoints
  - [x] Create a new FastAPI endpoint that accepts a page identifier parameter and returns detailed access permissions for the requesting user, including whether they can view the page, what actions they can perform, and any resource-specific permissions they have. This endpoint should evaluate the user's role, assignment relationships, and ownership permissions to provide comprehensive access information.
  - [x] Implement role-specific page access rules that define which pages each user role can access, including static rules for pages like HR-only department management and dynamic rules for pages like employee profiles that depend on ownership or supervisory relationships.
  - [x] Design the response format to include not just boolean access flags but also contextual information about why access is granted or denied, helping the frontend make informed decisions about what UI elements to show or hide.
- [x] **2.1.2** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Implement React route guards
  - [x] Create a ProtectedRoute React component that wraps other components and performs server-side role validation before rendering content, including loading states while validation occurs and error states when access is denied. The component should be reusable across different pages with configurable access requirements.
  - [x] Implement server-side validation calls within the route guard component that check page access permissions using the role validation API endpoint, handling network errors gracefully and providing fallback behavior when the validation service is unavailable.
  - [x] Design proper error pages for unauthorized access that clearly explain why access was denied and provide helpful navigation options, such as links to accessible pages or instructions for requesting additional permissions.
- [x] **2.1.3** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Apply route protection to sensitive pages
  - [x] Protect the employee creation page to ensure only HR_ADMIN users can access it, preventing other users from attempting to create employee records even if they manipulate the URL directly or use browser developer tools.
  - [x] Secure the departments management page and its admin functions so that only HR_ADMIN users can view, create, edit, or delete departments and their associated assignment types, with proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts.
  - [x] Implement protection for individual employee edit pages that combines role-based access (HR_ADMIN can edit anyone) with ownership validation (employees can edit their own records), ensuring the proper editing interface is shown based on the user's permissions.
- [x] **2.1.4** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Test route protection
  - [x] Create comprehensive tests that attempt to access protected pages with different user roles, including direct URL manipulation, programmatic navigation, and bookmark access to verify that server-side validation prevents unauthorized access in all scenarios.
  - [x] Verify that proper redirects and error messages are displayed when access is denied, ensuring users receive clear feedback about why they cannot access certain pages and what steps they might take to gain access if appropriate.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users cannot access unauthorized pages even with direct URLs
- Proper error messages shown for insufficient permissions
- Role-based navigation remains functional

#### Task 2.2: Enhanced Frontend Role Checking
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Completed Time**: 3 hours  

**Subtasks:**
- [x] **2.2.1** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Improve role checking hooks
  - [x] Create a React hook `useCanAccessEmployee` that takes an employee ID and returns a boolean indicating whether the current user can view that employee's information, including server-side validation to ensure the permission check cannot be bypassed by client-side manipulation. The hook should handle loading states and cache results to avoid redundant API calls.
  - [x] Implement a `useCanEditEmployee` hook that determines whether the current user can modify a specific employee's information, checking both role-based permissions and ownership relationships. This hook should provide real-time permission checking that updates when user roles or relationships change.
  - [x] Enhance existing role-checking hooks by adding server-side validation calls that verify client-side permissions against the backend authorization system, ensuring that UI decisions are based on authoritative permission data rather than potentially stale or manipulated client-side role information.
- [x] **2.2.2** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Add role-based UI element hiding
  - [x] Implement conditional rendering logic that hides sensitive form fields like SSN and bank account information based on the user's role and relationship to the employee record, ensuring that sensitive data is not even present in the DOM for unauthorized users.
  - [x] Create dynamic action button visibility that shows or hides edit, delete, and administrative buttons based on the user's permissions for specific resources, preventing users from seeing actions they cannot perform while maintaining a clean, role-appropriate interface.
  - [x] Add appropriate loading states during permission checks to prevent UI flickering and provide smooth user experience while the system determines what elements should be visible, including skeleton loading for complex permission-dependent sections.
- [x] **2.2.3** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Test enhanced role checking
  - [x] Develop tests that verify UI elements are properly hidden or shown based on user roles and permissions, including tests that check DOM content to ensure sensitive elements are not just hidden with CSS but actually excluded from the page structure.
  - [x] Create comprehensive tests for permission hooks that simulate different user roles and employee relationships, verifying that the hooks return correct values and update appropriately when underlying data changes or when users switch roles.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- UI elements properly hidden based on user permissions
- Role checks include server-side validation
- Smooth user experience with appropriate loading states

### üß™ **PRIORITY 4: SECURITY TESTING**

#### Task 4.1: Comprehensive Security Testing
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours  

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] **4.1.1** Role-based access control tests
  - [ ] Create comprehensive test suites that systematically test every combination of user role and API endpoint to ensure that access controls work correctly across the entire system, including edge cases where users might have multiple roles or transitional role states.
  - [ ] Develop tests that verify proper HTTP error responses are returned for unauthorized access attempts, ensuring that 401 responses are returned for unauthenticated requests, 403 responses for insufficient permissions, and that error messages provide appropriate information without revealing sensitive system details.
  - [ ] Implement tests that verify data filtering works correctly for different user roles by comparing the data returned to users with different permission levels accessing the same resources, ensuring that sensitive information is properly filtered based on role and relationship permissions.
- [ ] **4.1.2** Data ownership validation tests
  - [ ] Create test scenarios where employees attempt to access other employees' personal information, assignment data, and sensitive fields, verifying that the system properly blocks unauthorized access while allowing legitimate access to their own data.
  - [ ] Develop tests that verify supervisor access controls work correctly by testing supervisors' ability to access data for employees they supervise versus employees outside their supervisory authority, ensuring the assignment-supervisor relationship logic functions properly.
  - [ ] Implement tests that confirm HR_ADMIN users can override normal ownership restrictions and access any employee data while still respecting basic authentication requirements, ensuring administrative functions work properly without creating security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **4.1.3** Frontend security tests
  - [ ] Create automated tests that attempt direct URL access to protected pages using different user roles, including bookmarked URLs, manually typed URLs, and programmatically generated navigation attempts to ensure server-side route protection cannot be bypassed.
  - [ ] Develop tests that verify client-side role checks cannot be bypassed through browser developer tools, JavaScript console manipulation, or other client-side attack vectors, ensuring that security decisions are always validated server-side.
  - [ ] Implement tests for session timeout and re-authentication flows, verifying that expired sessions are properly handled, users are redirected to login when necessary, and sensitive operations require fresh authentication as appropriate.
- [ ] **4.1.4** Penetration testing scenarios
  - [ ] Design and execute tests that attempt privilege escalation by manipulating session data, role information, or user identifiers to gain unauthorized access to higher-privilege functions, ensuring that the system properly validates all security claims.
  - [ ] Create tests that verify session security including session fixation attacks, session hijacking attempts, and improper session handling, ensuring that session tokens are properly generated, stored, and validated throughout the user's interaction with the system.
  - [ ] Develop comprehensive API security tests that attempt to access protected endpoints using invalid, expired, modified, or stolen authentication tokens, verifying that the system properly validates all authentication and authorization claims for every request.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All security tests pass with proper error handling
- No unauthorized data access possible
- Frontend protection cannot be bypassed

## Alternative Approaches

### Current Approach Evaluation

#### ‚úÖ Strengths of Current REST + FastAPI Approach
- **Mature Ecosystem**: FastAPI has excellent documentation and widespread adoption
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic schemas provide strong type validation and OpenAPI generation
- **Performance**: FastAPI's async capabilities and performance characteristics are well-suited for HR workloads
- **Learning Curve**: Team familiarity with REST patterns reduces implementation risk
- **Tooling**: Excellent debugging, monitoring, and development tools available

#### ‚ùå Weaknesses and Complexity Issues
- **Schema Proliferation**: Current approach requires multiple Pydantic schemas per entity (EmployeeResponseHR, EmployeeResponseBasic, EmployeeResponseOwner) leading to maintenance burden
- **Manual Permission Logic**: Each endpoint requires custom permission checking and response filtering logic
- **N+1 Permission Queries**: Checking ownership and supervisor relationships can lead to database performance issues
- **Frontend-Backend Coupling**: Frontend needs to understand complex permission rules to hide/show UI elements
- **Testing Complexity**: Need to test every role √ó endpoint combination manually
- **Code Duplication**: Similar permission patterns repeated across multiple endpoints

---

### Alternative Technology Approaches

#### 1. üöÄ **GraphQL with Field-Level Authorization (Recommended)**

**Technology Stack:**
- **Backend**: Strawberry GraphQL (Python) or GraphQL with Ariadne
- **Frontend**: Apollo Client with React
- **Auth**: Field-level resolvers with context-based permissions

**Advantages for Security:**
- **Field-Level Control**: Instead of multiple response schemas, define single types with field-level authorization
- **Automatic Filtering**: Fields are automatically excluded based on resolver permissions
- **Query Introspection Control**: Can disable introspection in production and control schema exposure by role
- **Single Source of Truth**: Permission logic defined once per field, not per endpoint
- **Performance**: Built-in query optimization and data loading patterns prevent N+1 issues

**Developer Experience Benefits:**
- **Schema-First Design**: Types defined once, permissions declared declaratively
- **Auto-Generated Frontend Types**: TypeScript types automatically generated from schema
- **Unified API Surface**: Single endpoint handles all data access patterns
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Built-in support for real-time updates when permissions change
- **Developer Tools**: GraphQL Playground provides excellent introspection and testing

**Security Implementation Example Approach:**
Instead of multiple schemas, define permissions at field level:
```
type Employee {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  workEmail: String @auth(requires: ["EMPLOYEE_OWNER", "SUPERVISOR", "HR_ADMIN"])
  ssn: String @auth(requires: ["EMPLOYEE_OWNER", "HR_ADMIN"])
  bankAccount: String @auth(requires: ["EMPLOYEE_OWNER", "HR_ADMIN"])
}
```

**Migration Strategy:**
- Phase 1: Implement GraphQL alongside existing REST endpoints
- Phase 2: Migrate frontend components one-by-one to GraphQL
- Phase 3: Deprecate REST endpoints after full migration
- Estimated Migration Time: 2-3 weeks

#### 2. üîê **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with Policy Engine**

**Technology Stack:**
- **Policy Engine**: Open Policy Agent (OPA) or AWS Cedar
- **Backend**: FastAPI with policy evaluation middleware
- **Frontend**: Policy-aware UI components

**Advantages:**
- **Declarative Policies**: Complex permission rules defined in policy language rather than code
- **Dynamic Authorization**: Policies can consider context like time, location, data sensitivity
- **External Policy Management**: Security team can modify policies without code changes
- **Audit Trail**: All authorization decisions logged with reasoning
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Can implement data masking, partial access, conditional permissions

**Example Policy Approach:**
```rego
# OPA Rego Policy Example
allow {
  input.user.role == "HR_ADMIN"
}

allow {
  input.user.role == "EMPLOYEE"
  input.user.employee_id == input.resource.employee_id
  input.field != "ssn"
  input.field != "bank_account"
}

allow {
  input.user.role == "SUPERVISOR"
  supervisor_relationship(input.user.employee_id, input.resource.employee_id)
  input.field != "ssn"
  input.field != "bank_account"
}
```

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Learning curve for policy language
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- Excellent for compliance-heavy environments
- Future-proof for complex permission requirements

#### 3. üèóÔ∏è **Domain-Driven Design with Bounded Contexts**

**Architecture Approach:**
- **Employee Context**: Handles employee data with internal authorization
- **HR Context**: Manages sensitive data access and compliance
- **Assignment Context**: Handles work relationships and supervisor permissions
- **Audit Context**: Centralized logging and monitoring

**Advantages:**
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each domain manages its own security rules
- **Microservice Ready**: Can scale to separate services if needed
- **Team Ownership**: Different teams can own different contexts
- **Reduced Coupling**: Changes in one domain don't affect others

**Security Benefits:**
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection across contexts
- **Specialized Security**: Each context implements security appropriate to its data sensitivity
- **Event-Driven Auditing**: Cross-context events automatically logged
- **Data Residency**: Sensitive data can be isolated in specific contexts

#### 4. üîí **Zero Trust API Architecture**

**Technology Stack:**
- **Service Mesh**: Istio or Linkerd for inter-service communication
- **Identity Provider**: OAuth2/OIDC with fine-grained scopes
- **API Gateway**: Kong or Envoy with authentication/authorization plugins

**Security Principles:**
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request validated regardless of source
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions granted for each operation
- **Encrypted Communication**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

**Implementation Benefits:**
- **Enterprise Grade**: Suitable for large-scale, security-critical deployments
- **Vendor Agnostic**: Can work with multiple cloud providers
- **Compliance Ready**: Built-in features for SOC2, HIPAA, etc.
- **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring and observability

- Require detailed audit trails with reasoning
- Have dedicated security/compliance team

#### **Choose DDD If:**
- Large team with multiple domains
- Planning future microservice architecture
- Need clear ownership boundaries
- Have complex business logic beyond simple CRUD
- Want independent deployment capabilities

#### **Stick with Current Approach If:**
- Small team with limited GraphQL experience
- Tight timeline constraints
- Simple permission requirements unlikely to change
- Limited resources for learning new technologies
- Existing REST patterns working well for business needs
